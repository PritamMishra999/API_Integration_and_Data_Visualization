üìòDESCRIPTION/OVERVIEW

The API Integration and Data Visualization application is a Python-based tool designed to fetch real-time cryptocurrency price data using the CoinGecko API and present it in a visually insightful format. This lightweight yet powerful script allows users to retrieve historical price data of a selected cryptocurrency over a defined number of past days and automatically generate an interactive line chart illustrating the price trend. It is a helpful utility for developers, traders, analysts, and educators who wish to explore or demonstrate how to integrate APIs with data visualization in Python.

üöÄ Features

API Integration: The script uses the CoinGecko API to fetch up-to-date market data.
Customizable Parameters: Users can specify which cryptocurrency to analyze, the currency to display prices in, and the number of days to visualize.
Data Parsing: Extracts timestamps and price values from the API‚Äôs JSON response.
Graphical Representation: Uses matplotlib and seaborn to plot a line graph for intuitive and easy-to-read visualization.
Error Handling: Includes robust handling for potential issues such as failed API requests or malformed responses.

üìÇ Project Structure
The project consists of a single Python script:
app.py ‚Äî The main script containing all logic for API calls, data processing, and plotting.

üîß Configuration
The application is fully configurable through simple variables defined at the beginning of the app.py script. You can modify the following parameters to tailor the data retrieval and visualization:
COIN_ID = "bitcoin"      # e.g., "ethereum", "solana", etc.
CURRENCY = "usd"         # e.g., "eur", "inr", etc.
DAYS = 7                 # Number of past days to visualize
By changing these values, the app can be repurposed for different cryptocurrencies, currencies, or time spans without modifying the core logic.

üì¶ Requirements
1. Python 3.x
2. requests
3. matplotlib
4. seaborn

Install dependencies using pip:
pip install requests matplotlib seaborn

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage
This will execute the following steps:
1. Send a GET request to the CoinGecko API to fetch the price data for the specified coin.
2. Extract the time-series data from the JSON response.
3. Convert UNIX timestamps to human-readable datetime objects.
4. Plot the data using matplotlib and seaborn with a visually appealing dark grid style.
5. Display a responsive graph showing how the price of the selected cryptocurrency has changed over time.

üìä Output Visualization
The final output is a time-series line chart with:
1. A clean, labeled X-axis showing date and time.
2. A Y-axis indicating the price in the selected currency.
3. A title summarizing the data context (coin, currency, and time period).
4. Gridlines and axis labels for improved readability.

üö® Error Handling
The script includes checks to ensure a successful API response. If the API call fails or the expected data format is not received, meaningful error messages will be printed, preventing crashes and aiding in debugging.

üîç Use Cases
1. Demonstrate API integration and data visualization in coding tutorials or classrooms.
2. Build foundational tools for crypto price monitoring.
3. Extend it into a larger dashboard or analytics system.
4. Use it for data collection and research purposes.

üß© Notes
Ensure you have an active internet connection.
CoinGecko's public API is rate-limited ‚Äî avoid excessive requests.
